  abstract  = "Purchase and consumption behaviors in daily life often are
               repetitive and performed in customary places, leading consumers
               to develop habits. When habits have formed, environmental cues
               can activate the practiced responses in the absence of conscious
               decision making. This research tested these ideas using a
               longitudinal design. We predicted that regardless of their
               explicit intentions, consumers would repeat habits to purchase
               fast food, watch TV news, and take the bus. The results yielded
               the anticipated pattern in which participants repeated habitual
               behaviors even if they reported intentions to do otherwise.
               Intentions only guided behavior in the absence of strong habits.
               This study ruled out a number of artifactual accounts for these
               findings including that they arise from the level of abstraction
               at which intentions are identified, the certainty with which
               participants held intentions, a restriction of range in the
               measures, and the strategy participants used to estimate
               frequency of past performance.",

  abstract  = "AbstractConsumers sometimes act like creatures of habit,
               automatically repeating past behavior with little regard to
               current goals and valued outcomes. To explain this phenomenon,
               we show that habits are a specific form of automaticity in which
               responses are directly cued by the contexts (e.g., locations,
               preceding actions) that consistently covaried with past
               performance. Habits are prepotent responses that are quick to
               activate in memory over alternatives and that have a
               slow‐to‐modify memory trace. In daily life, the tendency to act
               on habits is compounded by everyday demands, including time
               pressures, distraction, and self‐control depletion. However,
               habits are not immune to deliberative processes. Habits are
               learned largely as people pursue goals in daily life, and habits
               are broken through the strategic deployment of effortful
               self‐control. Also, habits influence the post hoc inferences
               that people make about their behavior.",

               widely used in service establishments, even though little is

               goods, prior purchase frequency is a significant predictor of
               coupon redemption. Coupon redeemers were almost seven and a half

               postpromotion period compared to nonredeemers and subsequent
               purchase timing was not influenced by coupon redemption. As it

                  economic activity. Increasingly, consumer activity is moving
                  to the web, where digital traces of shopping and purchases
                  provide valuable data about consumer behavior. We analyze
                  these data extracted from emails and combine them with
                  demographic information to characterize, model, and predict
                  consumer behavior. Breaking down purchasing by age and
                  gender, we find that the amount of money spent on online
                  purchases grows sharply with age, peaking in late 30s. Men
                  are more frequent online purchasers and spend more money when
                  compared to women. Linking online shopping to income, we find
                  that shoppers from more affluent areas purchase more
                  expensive items and buy them more frequently, resulting in
                  significantly more money spent on online purchases. We also
                  look at dynamics of purchasing behavior and observe daily and
                  weekly cycles in purchasing behavior, similarly to other
                  online activities. More specifically, we observe temporal
                  patterns in purchasing behavior suggesting shoppers have
                  finite budgets: the more expensive an item, the longer the
                  shopper waits since the last purchase to buy it. We also
                  observe that shoppers who email each other purchase more
                  similar items than socially unconnected shoppers, and this
                  effect is particularly evident among women. Finally, we build
                  a model to predict when shoppers will make a purchase and how
                  much will spend on it. We find that temporal features improve
                  prediction accuracy over competitive baselines. A better
                  understanding of consumer behavior can help improve marketing
                  efforts and make online shopping more pleasant and efficient.",

  abstract  = "This study develops and estimates a dynamic model of consumer
               choice behavior in markets for seasonal goods, where products
               are sold over a finite season and availability is limited. In
               these markets, retailers often use dynamic markdown policies in
               which an initial retail price is announced at the beginning of
               the season and the price is subsequently marked down as the
               season progresses. Strategic consumers face a trade-off between
               purchasing early in the season, when prices are higher but goods
               are available, and purchasing later, when prices are lower but
               the stockout risk is higher. If the good starts providing
               utility as soon as it is purchased (e.g., apparel), consumers
               purchasing earlier in the season can also get more use from the
               product compared to those purchasing later. Our structural model
               incorporates three features essential for modeling the demand
               for seasonal goods: changing prices, limited availability, and
               possible dependence of total consumption utility on the time of
               purchase. In this model, heterogeneous consumers have
               expectations about future prices and product availability, and
               they strategically time their purchases. We estimate the model
               using aggregate sales and inventory data from a fashion goods
               retailer. The results indicate that, in the fashion goods
               context, ignoring consumers' expectations about future
               availability or the change in total consumption utility over the
               season can lead to biased demand estimates. We find that
               strategic consumers delay their purchases to take advantage of
               markdowns and that these strategic delays hurt the retailer's
               revenues. Retailer revenues facing strategic consumers are 9\%
               lower than they would have been facing myopic consumers. Limited
               availability, on the other hand, reduces the extent of strategic
               delays by motivating consumers to purchase earlier. We find that
               the impact of strategic delays on retailer revenues would have
               been as high as 35\% if there were no stockout risk. By means of
               counterfactual experiments, we show that the highest retailer
               profits are achieved by offering small markdowns early in the
               season. On the other hand, given current markdown percentages,
               the retailer can improve profits by carrying less stock as
               consumers accelerate purchases and purchase at higher prices
               when they anticipate scarcity in future periods. As long as the
               reduction in availability is not great, the profit gain from
               earlier higher-priced sales can overcome the loss resulting from
               the reduction in overall sales.",

  abstract  = "Subscription programs have become increasingly popular among a
               wide variety of retailers and marketplace platforms.
               Subscription programs give members access to a set of exclusive
               benefits for a fixed fee up front. In this article, the authors
               examine the causal effect of a subscription program on customer
               behavior. To account for self-selection and identify the
               individual-level treatment effects, they combine a
               difference-in-differences approach with a generalized random
               forests procedure that matches each member of the subscription
               program with comparable nonmembers. The authors find that
               subscription leads to a large increase in customer purchases.
               The effect of subscription is economically significant,
               persistent over time, and heterogeneous across customers.
               Interestingly, only one-third of the effect on customer
               purchases is due to the economic benefits of the subscription
               program, and the remaining two-thirds is attributed to the
               noneconomic effect. Evidence supports that members experience a
               sunk cost fallacy due to the up-front payment that subscription
               programs entail. Finally, the authors illustrate how firms can
               calculate the profitability of a subscription program and

	abstract = {The demand for fluid milk products has changed dramatically in recent years not only in terms of lower levels consumed but also in terms of the composition of the products consumed. A time-series based demand system analysis of the market for lowfat and whole milk products is developed incorporating the effects of changes in prices and demographic characteristics. From the estimated model, the impacts of future changes in the demographic profile of the U.S. population on fluid milk demand are analyzed.},
