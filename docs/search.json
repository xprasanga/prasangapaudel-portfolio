    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Milk and dairy products are an important component of American diet, consumed at breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and used in numerous processed foods. Dairy products supply key nutrients and contribute significantly to public health and nutrition. At the same time, dairy sector also represents a significant portion of US agricultural output. Given it’s importance to nutrition and economy, understanding the determinants of milk consumption and production is crucial for policy makers, producers, and other market stakeholders.\nUsing the historical data on milk based on United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) dataset and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), specifically looking into the patterns in milk characteristics, milk production, and consumption, we will estimate the demand and supply relationship for milk in the United States over the past several decades. This study will try to investigate the relationship between milk prices, dairy costs, milk production, as well as try to understand the dynamic relation between changes in milk production, milk consumption and milk prices. Reports from Economic Research Service (ERS) show that per-person per-day fluid cow milk consumption has declined from 0.78 cups/day in 1990 to 0.49 cups/day in 2019 (Stewart et al. 2021). Recent studies such as (Cornelisse 2023) also show that while consumption of fluid milk has decreased, consumption of processed dairy products has increased substantially.\nWe are seeking the answers to our two primary research question:\n\nHow sensitive is fluid consumption to changes in the price of milk? (This is basically the price elasticity of demand of milk and milk products.)\nHow do milk prices and feed costs affect aggregate milk production? (This is basically the price elasticity of supply and feed price elasticity.)\n\nThese questions have both industrial and theoretical relevance. We as economists mostly assume that food is inelastic in demand, and through this research we would like to test this statement. Better understanding of this elasticity will inform us on how to orient our tax and subsidy policies. It can also guide investment decisions and improve market efficiency."

(Gan 2022) also found demand to be inelastic.\nGiven that our data will incorporate a wide range of data including the most recent ones as well as other past decades, we expect that our data might provide us with different results and variability.\nAdditionally, to control for endogeneity that arises from the simultaneous determination of prices and quantities in the market, we will also use Instrument Variable (IV) approach for the coefficient estimation.

These models are widely used in agricultural economics research. Our use of per-capita consumption for fluid milk tries to approximates the average consumer behaviour at macro level, while our milk production aggregated nationally approximates a representative producer sector. We do lose some heterogeneity while looking things as aggregagate level. Acknowledging the technological progress and shift in market pattern over the decades, we will also introduce “decade” as a control variable itself for further robustness of our result."

Supply elasticity is less than 1, so production responds less than proportionally to price, reflecting technological and biological limits to expansion.\nThe demand in 1980 was less elastic due to lesser substitutes and the overall demand was high due to high per capita fluid milk consumption. Compared to 1980, the present demand curve is more elastic and the overall quantity demended in the market has also dropped significantly. On the supply side, prices were higher due to less efficient farms and higher production costs in 1980.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This figure shows the relative shift in supply and demand during 1980’s and 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the technological progress (better milking machines, better veterinary care, better animal breeding) and commercialized way of farming, the production cost for a gallon of milk has reduced and we have a flatter (elastic) supply curve as producers can quickly adjust to price changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This figure shows the gradual changes in elasticities in demand and supply due to technological progress and changes in consumption patterns."

Although it is not a good idea to use variables with too many categories, but in this dataset the variables are too complex to categorize into smaller groups, so will proceed as it is.\nThe model is given as:\n\\(score_i\\) = \\(β_0\\) + \\(β_1\\) \\(days_i\\) + \\(β_2\\) \\(state_i\\) + \\(β_3\\) \\(condition_i\\) + \\(β_4\\) \\(measure_i\\)\n\n#fitting linear regression\nlm_fit &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(score ~ days + state + condition + measure_name, \n      data = train_data)\n\nNow, due to a very high number of categories within the variable measure, we will get a lot of predictor variables in our regression model. But, seeking causality is not our objective here.

    "text": "6.3 LASSO regression\nNow, lets fit the same model using lasso-regression. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a statistical tool, and also a type of linear regression that adds a penalty (L1 regularization) to shrink coefficients. This can force ciefficients of some less important predictors to become exactly zero, and hence performing an automatic feature selection, preventing overfitting, and simpliflying models especially with many variables.\nThe model for lasso is also the same model used in OLS, we just add a penalty value of 0.1 on this estimation process.\n\\(score_i\\) = \\(β_0\\) + \\(β_1\\) \\(days_i\\) + \\(β_2\\) \\(state_i\\) + \\(β_3\\) \\(condition_i\\) + \\(β_4\\) \\(measure_i\\)\nFitting the model using LASSO.\n\n#setting up Lasso model specification\nlasso_spec &lt;- linear_reg(\n  penalty = 0.1,  #Regularization strength \n  mixture = 1     # 1 = Lasso\n) %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"glmnet\")\n\n#fitting Lasso model\nlasso_fit &lt;- lasso_spec %&gt;% \n  fit(score ~ days + state + condition + measure_name, \n      data = train_data)\n\nNow, lets look into the coefficients to see if any factors were dropped by LASSO regularization.\n\n# coefficients (non-zero ones only)\ntidy(lasso_fit) %&gt;% \n  filter(estimate != 0) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(abs(estimate)))\n\n# A tibble: 73 × 3\n   term                                                         estimate penalty\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                                           &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 measure_namePercentage of patients who left the emergency d…   -159.      0.1\n 2 measure_nameAverage time patients spent in the emergency de…    151.      0.1\n 3 measure_nameAverage time patients spent in the emergency de…    142.      0.1\n 4 measure_nameAverage time patients spent in the emergency de…     95.7     0.1\n 5 measure_namePercentage of patients who came to the emergenc…    -93.7     0.1\n 6 measure_nameAverage (median) time patients spent in the eme…     93.2     0.1\n 7 conditionEmergency Department                                    80.4     0.1\n 8 (Intercept)                                                      68.3     0.1\n 9 conditionElectronic Clinical Quality Measure                    -66.8     0.1\n10 stateRI                                                          61.8     0.1\n# ℹ 63 more rows\n\n\nInterestingly, our OLS regression has 78 predictors in the final estimated model but our LASSO regression has only 73 predictors which means some variables were dropped by our LASSO model. If we want to know which variable was dropped, we can simply ask R to print the full regression result and then we can identify which factor was considered unnecessary by LASSO regression. But, as discussed earlier, we are not here for causality.\nLet’s look into the performance of our LASSO regression.\n\n#making predictions\ntrain_results &lt;- train_data %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(predict(lasso_fit, new_data = train_data))\n\n#evaluating performance\nlasso_metrics &lt;- train_results %&gt;% \n  metrics(truth = score, estimate = .pred)\n\nThe (Root Mean Squared Errors) RMSE, \\(R^2\\) value, and (Mean Absolute Deviance) MAE for the LASSO model is given below.\n\nprint(lasso_metrics)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 rmse    standard      35.0  \n2 rsq     standard       0.875\n3 mae     standard      21.7  \n\n\nWe can observe a RMSE value of 35, which is smaller than what we observed for the OLS model. The R-squared value is 0.875 which is quite simillar to the regression model.\nNow, lets also check the model fit graphically.\n\n#Observed vs Predicted plot\nggplot(train_results, aes(x = score, y = .pred)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"darkorange\") +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"Lasso Regression Performance\",\n       subtitle = paste(\"Penalty =\", lasso_fit$spec$args$penalty),\n       x = \"Observed Scores\", \n       y = \"Predicted Scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe observed-predicted plot also shows a good fit as observed for the regression model."

If we compare the three models, the Random Forest model has the lowest RMSE and the highest R-squared value. Thus, RF performs the best.\nLet’s also perform a visual test for the model fit.\n\n# Observed vs Predicted plot\nggplot(rf_results, aes(x = score, y = .pred)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Random Forest: Observed vs Predicted\",\n       x = \"Actual Score\", y = \"Predicted Score\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe that the random forest model shows a very small difference between the observed and the predicted with values clustered around the fitted line. Hence, it is a better model.\nTo summarize, lets tabulate the performance metrices of all three models: OLS regression, LASSO regression, and Random Forest model, all in a single table.\n\n#comparing all models\nbind_rows(\n  linear_reg = metrics,\n  lasso = lasso_metrics,\n  random_forest = rf_metrics,\n  .id = \"model\"\n) %&gt;% \n  select(model, .metric, .estimate) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = .metric, values_from = .estimate)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  model          rmse   rsq   mae\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 linear_reg     34.9 0.876  21.9\n2 lasso          35.0 0.875  21.7\n3 random_forest  26.6 0.929  14.0\n\n\nIt is clearly visible that Random Forest model has the lowest RMSE value and the highest R-squared value. MAE is also the smallest for the RF model. All three metrices show that Random Forest model provides the best fit for our equation."

Our study studies how customer demographics, purchase-related characteristics, incentive factors, and delivery options affect the frequency of purchase using various econometrics techniques. Based on a dataset of 1120 U.S. consumers, our analysis utilizes Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and the two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach to make accurate explanations of purchase behavior using age, gender, income, amount spent, ratings, season, promotions, subscription, and purchase history.\nResults from our OLS estimation revealed that age, income, previous purchases, and buying fashion related items positively and significantly influence their purchase behavior. On the other hand, males and consumers who spend more per transactions tend to purchase less frequently. Seasonal patterns are also indicated, with significantly higher purchases during spring and winter. The 2SLS approach confirmed that subscription is endogenous, and once corrected, it’s effect seems to be statistically insignificant.\nOur findings highlight the importance of behavioral history and demographic targeting as effective source of increasing purchase frequencies. Furthermore, business should focus on personalized promotions, habit-based incentives and time-sensitive marketing campaigns to promote repeated purchase and higher revenue.\nKeywords: customer behavior, promos, purchase frequency"

    "text": "4.2 Robust SE OLS\nIf our null hypothesis of “The residuals are normally distributed” is violated, we cannot trust our standard errors anymore, and therefore we will have to account for the heteroskedastic errors and calculate the heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. Then only we can trust the standard errors and thus the t-statistics.\nFinally, we will also test if we have a problem of endogeneity with our independent variables and we will try to solve it using the IV-regression. For our Instrument Variable approach, we will perform further test for endogeneity and test for weak instrument.\nWe are suspicious that our variable subscription is an endogenous variable. Because, customers who buy more from a particular store tend to have a subscription in order to qualify for subscription discounts and special offers. Therefore, frequency of purchase and subscription are simultaneously determined. As endogeneity means that our OLS is biased and inconsistent, we may have to calculate the model using 2SLS approach as a correct approach to correct for endogeneity of subscription.\nIn that case, let’s first define our 2SLS regression model with instrument: marketing offer for subscription enrollment."

We obtained a good R2 value of 62.9%, which suggest that the model can moderately explain the purchase behavior of the individual. There are many micro-economic and macro-economic factors that we did not control for, therefore we expect our model to perform moderately.\nWe also performed some diagnostic test for our OLS model.\n\n5.2.1 Model Diagnosis\nTo verify that these assumptions are met, we will perform a test for normality, heteroskedasticity and endogeneity.\n\n5.2.1.1 Linearity Assumption\n\n# Lets extract residuals and fitted values from the OLS model.\nresiduals_ols &lt;- residuals(model_ols_sub)\nfitted_ols &lt;- fitted(model_ols_sub)\n\n# Linearity Assumption\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted plot\nplot(fitted_ols, residuals_ols,\n     xlab=\"Fitted Values\", ylab=\"Residuals\",\n     main=\"Residuals vs Fitted\")\nabline(h=0, col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals are fairly distributed across all individuals.

The Shapiro-Wilk test fails to reject the normality of errors. The BP test for heteroskedasticity also fails to reject the null hypothesis of heteroskedasticity. Therefore, the classical assumption of homoskedasticity and normality of errors holds for our data."

Therefore, our variable subscription is endogenous. We used marketing offer as an instrument variable for subscription, especially because marketing offers for subscription can explain whether the individual gets a subscription and marketing offers for subscription does not directly explain the purchase frequency of the individual. Statistically, marketing offer is a strong instrument as we reject the null hypothesis of weak instrument with a p-value of 0.000. As our model is just identified with one IV and one endogenous variable, we won’t perform the over-identification test.\nThe robust standard errors in the case of endogeneity are not useful. Generalized Least Squares (GLS) also cannot correct for endogeneity. Therefore, IV-estimation is the best approach in this case.\nBased on IV-estimation, we can make the following inference.\nAge: 0.043, for every one-year increase in a customer’s age, their purchase frequency is estimated to increase by 0.043 units, holding all other variables constant. This effect is highly statistically significant.\nAmount: -0.01, for every one-unit increase in the average transaction amount, the purchase frequency is estimated to decrease by 0.011 units. This suggests that customers who spend more per transaction tend to shop slightly less often. This effect is highly statistically significant.\nPrevious purchases: 0.320, for every one additional previous purchase a customer has made, their current purchase frequency is estimated to increase by 0.320 units, indicating strong customer loyalty or habit formation. This effect is highly statistically significant.\nIncome: 0.0008, while the number is small due to the scale of income, this indicates that higher income is associated with a statistically significant, slight increase in purchase frequency.\nGender: -0.847, male customers are estimated to have a purchase frequency that is 0.847 units lower than the reference gender category (primarily Female), holding all else constant. This is a highly significant difference.\nItem-Fashion: 1.030, customers engaging with ‘fashion’ items have a frequency that is 1.030 units higher than those in the reference category.\nRating: 0.231, a one-point increase in customer rating is associated with a 0.231 unit increase in purchase frequency. This is a marginally significant effect.\nSubscription: -1.104, in the OLS model, this was highly significant, but the IV results suggest that once endogeneity is accounted for, being subscribed has no statistically significant effect on purchase frequency. The previous OLS result (1.821) was probably biased upward. The IV (2SLS) regression isolates only the true causal effect of subscription using our instrument (marketing offer). When we used the IV method, the true effect of being subscribed turned out to be close to zero."

Additionally, while the mean and median values for each state appear reasonable, the wide range and high standard deviation suggest excessive randomness in Data_Value generation."

But majority of the predictors are insignificant in the model. This has lead to an insignificant increase in information to predict the dependent vriable and only around 62% variation in the dependent variable is explained by the model with all predictors. With only DOSE the performance is little weaker, with DOSE explaining around 50% of the variation."

It can observed that height (HT) significantly affect SEX. This kind of makes sense when we think about it in this way: Men and Women usually have a distinct height pattern. Men are usually tall and women are usually short in most of the countries. According to reports, the average height for US adult men is around 5’9” (175 cm) and for US adult women is about 5’4” (163 cm). So, prediction of someone’s SEX based on height is quite possible. Except height, all other factors included in the model are statistically insignificant.\nNow, we will need check the Accuracy and AUC values to compare the performance of our two models: Model 3 and Model 4."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/freebird/Documents/GitHub/prasangapaudel-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
